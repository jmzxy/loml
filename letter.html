            <h1>Hi, My love</h1>
            <p>You are aware that I am a shy person who struggles to express myself. You may not expect a love letter at this time, but my strong desire to express my feelings for you has compelled me to write this letter. I just want to tell you that I
                adore you and that you make me the happiest person on the planet. I promise to make you happy, and I will try to love you more than you love me. You are aware that we have overcome a significant challenge together this year. With such
                illness and the negativity of the pandemic, you've been a rock for me, both mentally and physically. I cannot express how grateful I am to have you in my life.In my heart, I only have immense gratitude for you. On sad days, I imagine we're
                cuddling and I'm starting to play with your hair. I can't even wait for the days when we don't have to be separated. When "come" has become "come home," we can simply say Good Night before going to bed. I sometimes feel like I don't deserve
                you because of how wonderful you are, but I want you to know that I am working every day to be a better person, a better version of myself for you, for us. I sincerely apologize for what I have done. I've been too preoccupied with my own
                life to show you the love and respect you deserve. I want you to know that I hold myself accountable for all of my actions, and if you give me a chance, I will prove my love to you. My darling, I adore you. It's sometimes difficult to
                put into words how much you mean to me. If it were possible, I would fly up in the sky and write I love you in big letters so the entire world could see them and know how much I adore you.</p>
